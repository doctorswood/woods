Beautiful semi-ancient woodland in Kent. Situated ten minutes drive from Faversham. 
Home to a variety of wildlife, trees and plants. Lovingly managed as a 
site of conservation, we host a wide variety of workshops and activities that support and help groups, individuals, families, friends and communities to reconnect, encourage creativity through the engagement with arts & nature.
This includes art and music workshops & woodland based craft activities.
